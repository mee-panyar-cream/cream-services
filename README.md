# Cream Services Project

This project defines the backend services for the CREAM project.

## Running With Localstack in Docker

Note serverless will check if you have any AWS credentials before it runs. 
If you don't have any, set some dummy ones like this:

serverless config credentials --provider aws --key AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE --secret wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY


Scripts are provided to run the docker commands for you.

```bash
make serverless-offline # runs serverless locally and localstack
```

At this point your lambda functions are still run by serverless because that has hot reload.

If you want to try deploying your lambda functions to localstack, then you can try this experimental target

```
make deploy-to-localstack
```

Then you view your deployed functions
```
awslocal lambda list-functions
```
However running functions this way has not yet been solved. 

## Create Required AWS resources in Localstack
You can install awscli-local which wraps the real aws cli but sets the server address to localhost.

```bash
pip install awscli-local
```

### Create S3 bucket
maybe!

awslocal s3api create-bucket --bucket ServerlessDeploymentBucket

### Localstack console is here
http://localhost:8080


### Requirements

- [Install the Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/installation/)
- [Configure your AWS CLI](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/)

### Installation

Install Node.js
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Install serverless
``` bash
npm install -g serverless
```

Clone current project
``` bash
git clone git@github.com:mee-panyar-cream/cream-services.git
```

Open project and install Node.js packages
``` bash
cd cream-services
npm install
```

### Usage

To run unit tests on your local

``` bash
$ npm test
```

To simulate API Gateway locally using [serverless-offline](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline)

``` bash
$ serverless offline start
```

You can then test locally with the following postman collection:

For **create**: [CREAM-services.postman_collection.json.zip](https://github.com/mee-panyar-cream/cream-services/files/3346839/CREAM-services.postman_collection.json.zip)

For **latest**: GET localhost:3000/meter/latest

Run your tests

``` bash
$ npm test
```

We may use Jest to run our tests. You can read more about setting up your tests [here](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/getting-started.html#content).

Deploy your project 

``` bash
$ serverless deploy
```

Deploy a single function

``` bash
$ serverless deploy function --function create
```

To add another function as a new file to your project, simply add the new file and add the reference to `serverless.yml`. The `webpack.config.js` automatically handles functions in different files.

To add environment variables to your project

1. Rename `env.example` to `env.yml`.
2. Add environment variables for the various stages to `env.yml`.
3. Uncomment `environment: ${file(env.yml):${self:provider.stage}}` in the `serverless.yml`.
